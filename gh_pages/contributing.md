### Contributing

This is a crazy idea of mine. But I think it's useful. I'm very open to comments, criticisms, suggestions, etc. Feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/issues) or submit a pull request. Instructions for contributing are available [in the README on GitHub](https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/blob/master/README.md#contributing). A list of contributors is [also available](https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

### Community Involvement

This project seems to have gained a lot more interest than I thought it would. As of April, 2017 there are [over 1,200 references on GitHub](https://github.com/search?l=&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.repostatus.org%2Fbadges%2F+-user%3A%22jantman%22&ref=advsearch&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
to repostatus.org badge URLs. I do *not* want to be the sole person making decisions for this project. I encourage everyone who finds
it useful to watch [the repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org) and provide their feedback in discussions, especially the
issues with the [discussion](https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adiscussion) or
["needs decision"](https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adiscussion+label%3A%22needs+decision%22)
labels. I'm handling the code updates, but I very much want this project to be driven based on consensus of those who use it.
